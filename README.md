# University_Grade_Manager

Project Name: University Grade Manager
Project Description:
The University Grade Manager is a C++ menu-driven application designed to manage and report student academic records. Built using Visual C++ 2017 or later, this system reads input from three structured data files—student.dat, course.dat, and grade.dat—to initialize a comprehensive database of students, courses, and grades.

Users interact with the system via a text-based menu that allows them to:

Add or modify grades

Remove existing grades

Generate student or course-specific grade reports

List all students and courses

Save all changes upon exit

The application validates inputs, prevents data corruption, and ensures consistency between student-course-grade associations. Grades are stored using efficient data structures such as vectors and linked lists to balance speed and memory use. Upon exit, all data is saved back to the original files, preserving the modified state of the system.
